      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Every mobile device has a unique and anonymous numeric id, that can be read at distance using the Bluetooth technology.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            CovidApp continuously scans your surroundings and collects the ids of the phones close to you, storing them in a secure centralized cloud database.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Our network of certified doctors daily updates the database with the ids of the devices belonging to confirmed Coronavirus infected.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If you have been in the proximity of an infected person you will be notified and get clear instruction on the next steps to follow.

      <h2>100% anonymous</h2>
      <p>
        We don't collect any personal data, not even your first name. Same for the surrounding devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our system relies only on the numeric Bluetooth ids of mobile devices, that in no way can be used to obtain personal data.

      <h2>Help the economy of your country</h2>
      <p>
        When a case of coronavirus is detected, your country’s institutions have to backtrack all the patient activities: who the patient has spent his time with, where the patient has been, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        This operation is extremely expensive and requires lots of efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the number of infections grows to the point in which this operation can’t be applied to all the cases, governments have to quarantine towns, regions or, even worse, the entire country.
      </p>
      <p>
        With our solution, we will immediately inform whoever has been close to the infected patient during the last 14 days to quarantine him/her-self and we will give him/her precise instructions about how to behave.
      </p>
      <p>
        This new operation is free for the people, free for the Health Institutions and extremely fast. You can protect your country economy just by download this app.
