      <h2><strong>Help us to save lives</strong></h2>
      <p>
        The coronavirus (<span class="nowrap">COVID-19</span>) pandemic is one of the biggest
        crises humankind has seen in modern times. It has a case fatality rate of nearly 15% in
        people over 80 years of age, and people with underlying conditions are also highly susceptible.
        If we don't take action, millions of people will die.
      </p>
      <p>
        Young people are less susceptible to fatality, but can help to spread the disease. From
        what we currently know, an infected person will infect <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32097725">2 additional people on average</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until we have effective treatments, it is important to limit the spread of the virus
        to protect the most vulnerable. One of the most effective methods for limiting the spread of
        <span class="nowrap">COVID-19</span> is to trace all contacts
        of someone that has been confirmed to have been infected. This
        is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing">contact tracing</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contact tracing involves identifying everyone that an infected person has been in contact with
        and providing them with health advice, such as instructions to quarantine themselves and prevent
        the spread.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the number of cases has grown, this process has become unmanageable, resulting in governments around
        the world to locking down entire countries to prevent the spread.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>CovidApp</strong> enables governments and public health services to rapidly trace all
        contacts for an infected person, issuing targeted advice directly to them. This means they're
        able to use new approaches to tackling coronavirus that don't necessarily involve locking a
        country down.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more people using the network, the more effective it can be in
        tackling coronavirus. Please, download the app and help us to save lives.
